Statute of Limitations on Debt Collection:
In this jurisdiction, the statute of limitations for written contracts, which includes credit card agreements and personal loans, is four (4) years. For oral contracts, the period is two (2) years. The statute of limitations begins on the date of the last payment or activity on the account. Once the statute of limitations has expired, a creditor can no longer successfully sue a debtor for collection. Attempting to collect on a time-barred debt is not illegal, but filing a lawsuit is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).

Interest Rates and Fees:
The maximum allowable interest rate for consumer loans under $50,000 is capped at 18% per annum. Late fees cannot exceed $25 or 5% of the past due amount, whichever is less. Creditors are prohibited from "stacking" late fees, meaning they cannot charge a late fee on a previously unpaid late fee.

Wage Garnishment:
A creditor must obtain a court judgment before they can garnish a debtor's wages. The maximum amount that can be garnished is the lesser of:
1. 25% of the debtor's disposable earnings for the week.
2. The amount by which the debtor's disposable earnings for that week exceed 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage.
Social Security benefits, disability benefits, and child support payments are exempt from garnishment.

Communication with Debtors:
Debt collectors are prohibited from contacting debtors at unreasonable times, defined as before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. local time. Collectors cannot contact a debtor at their place of employment if they have reason to believe the employer prohibits such calls. All communication must cease if the debtor submits a written request to stop contact, except to notify the debtor of specific action being taken.
